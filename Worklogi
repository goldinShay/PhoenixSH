I would like to add, update and remove my smart devices (think about lights, thermostats, etc) so my system is always up to date.
I would like a dashboard that displays the status and sensor readings of these devices in real time, so I can monitor them
I would like to be able to schedule tasks, so my home can operate automatically when Im not around
I would like to receive notifications, for example when a device detects abnormal readings 

It would be handy if each devives stimulates its behavior on its own thread, showcasing mutli- threading


Thermostat - Home heater controller on/off notifications on thresholds and temp read every 60 sec
*MISSING SENSORS: Temp, Light, Noise, smoke, volume (Updatable)

**********************add a reset list to the device menu options

// Default devices (from top of main)
        Light livingRoomLight = new Light("Living Room Light");
        Thermostat homeThermostat = new Thermostat( "Home Thermostat", 20.0, 25.0, notificationService);

        addDevice(livingRoomLight);
        addDevice(homeThermostat);
        
        
After adding multiple devices with similar names (like Light, Light2, etc.), test:

Deleting by exact name

Deleting by ID
